this is the only part that's battery backed up
this is going to become really freaking obvious
i don't paint
the science is there
what makes the heart unique
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
does any of this matter
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
but you know what
but you know what
so we decided to go to the mosque
and i thought we should just stay home
i feel that god knows me
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
you made it work for me
one year i came up with a bright idea
we know why kids don't learn
we can do this
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
i'm so sorry
the answer was no
and i got pretty into it
this is how stuff is made memorable
do you remember what it was
she got unlucky
that wasn't being asked
what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
but that's kind of a big problem
we have no control over these forces
that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
there's nothing underground about it
we only sell you airtime
it's right there for you to find
quite the opposite
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
that's not to say it's impossible
it was the coldest i've ever been
i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
now i know why i'm here
well guess what
so i went to church as often as i could
the question for us now is how much can we make of it
not a single one
how much can we change
so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
when we share ideas we all get more
they want to get out
let us have a hong kong nearby
allow many people to come in
how is that possible
that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
5 percent today
they won the game
so bear with me
and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
thank you very much
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
it cracked open my world
his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
she would hide in the closet
it's natural connective tissue
storytelling is so important
now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
what would happen
stories are amazing
but what does
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
it's about people
that even small scale farmers can leverage
we just need to act on it
the net outcome
this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
you're doing incredibly important work
please look at me
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
not the wife not the kids
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
he should not have been surprised
he also had 11 children
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
but i'm a big fan of you as a person
last week alone i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
they need support
we had law enforcement partners
i was terrified
the same tool that united us to topple dictators
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
out to dinner with family
but things have changed
and that's exactly what that is
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
you remember carlos
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
i had to do something
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
i can use it in my company
who's at the event
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
we can see everything on wikipedia
and that's bad
we can change our minds
and when we do the results will often surprise
what makes technology useful and usable
and when we're unprepared we overreact
and i did not know what to say
they're not my children
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
and work like a dog
i said we work together
tell me about that
that's your grandfather
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
we didn't understand the program
they were all white
so they felt safe to come there
and that's all
but i need your help
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
so was mother teresa
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
i have to take a year off
it really is quite phenomenal
and then i thought there's got to be a better way
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
we have to throw it away
well i was surprised
i did not know this
of course they would
now don't get me wrong
actually studied hormones
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
we can't see it most of the time
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
that robot put on a great show
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
do the same thing at work
and that's what i'm calling for here now
we connect more and more
so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
and we finally figured out how to do it
in fact it's more like five percent
thank you very much
and not just that
so what did they do
why is it important now
they met together
without it we literally can't interface with others
my history wasn't right
and it is important
i take it to therapy
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
and this change is getting more rapid
of course migration will become even more important
there will be invisible capacity
but the question is who will have it
it's not optional
it's not a luxury
they're not being shipped up here
we're going to eat these cows
as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
no plankton means no fish
and then we were alarmed to discover something
not when you get lung cancer
i don't understand
it had no choice
that's nothing special
i realize of course that all countries are unique
again it had no choice
just when that's the last thing you want to do
we need to reinvent labor organizing
we need portable health benefits
is it about earning as much as you possibly can
i would never want to do that
how should we live
how should we work
talk to farmers
so what can we do
only one percent of the people are actually farmers
well we bought one of these
we can open up city hall
yes it's hard
they can't get what they need when they need it
gov just six people
that's the status quo today
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
boy it matters a lot
your job needs to be challenging
what do you mean
you want to work for him
i feel guilty sometimes
he's a great guy
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
i wanted to understand who takes the job
so i started a research project with them
take a moment to say thank you
who cleans up after us
the economy needs them
that was her fight
seventy five percent of them are women and children
she was doing okay
she got a support network
she learned about her rights
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points to things
you're more cautious
you just move away
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
they change from person to person
but that is not the case at all
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
but that system has tons of problems
and nothing happened at all
so i'm in the media
or do you think the government should redistribute
when you're six maybe you can do that
are they a potential mate
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
are they attractive
how old are you
so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
you make it flow under and over
do they have a common cold
do they have aids
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
what do they have
the other was to be a baseball player
one was to be a soldier
they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
i'm not a military brat
i will be back
and this is true
but there's so much potential
brought in younger men
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
how much they do
look at the end to see the animal
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
it was incredibly hot
the boys are up there for a year
how does that work
it's not what i had expected
we have to answer that
that's what's so complicated about war
what is it that he misses
my other great passion is the environment
i was considered a radical
so let's get started now
that didn't go over really well
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
it's just not possible
why are we embedded in social networks
how far do they reach
how do they operate
i mean how do they form
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
it should be inspiring
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
how is that possible
i'm not short
now i'm ready for my interview
i needed an education
again let's just play
that doesn't probably happen every day
did i get my upgrade
we must adopt that way of giving back
i was right there with you
i don't look different
patriarchy is not boys and men
and he surprised me by saying you know what
i've tried engaging people
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
and guess what silicon valley
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
try it and let me know how it works for you
i even read many self help books
i would love to hear from you
the first lesson is about humility
they are the basis of every action that you take
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i'm totally serious
well that's what predictions are
it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
not what is it
and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
we're on the grid
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
could i go there
we let other people worry about it
who would i meet
you can walk around them
is it heavy
where would it go
i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
the whole internet
you can experience their sense of place
the key here really is knowledge
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
one billion people
but this is the source of innovation
and this leads to oddities
and then something falls off the wall
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charge before use
dan replies so often you won't even notice it
we don't use audio we don't use video
i'm a doctor
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
we can do that because we know
we shouldn't be nationalistic
well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
what if i had told her my story years ago
i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
after all i was a bit unconventional
like why did i really have to mow the lawn
and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
you can't run around in the dark
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
i want no part of any of that
i am full of contradictions
we have the right to respect
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
but it's not about fire and brimstone either
they have divergent values
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
there is an animated series in the works
and she's looking as young as ever
they have different interests
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
who cares about bosnia
take my child
i have to report it
they don't get their money out
she worked in a bank
i believe a story there has to be told
and this idea is actually nothing new
one way around this is to draw pictures
this is completely bizarre
i was able to do more things
i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery
and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
plus we have stem cells
not right now
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
what about manipulation
i love building robots
so that's mobile manipulation
i want to be the center of attention
this is when i was in texas
i would listen to the heart
i teach at stanford
they had her scanned inside out
i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
we're losing a ritual
we now have a platform
and who does that benefit
and my whole world did open up
take a look at these
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
they want a treatment
here's where i stand
it wasn't who i was
your wife left you
and here's what you need to know
i'm a fifth generation texan
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
i guess i'm doing it right now
she said yeah
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
why did you bring this up
at what point did i think that was a good idea
what do you do
i study shame
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
let's think about your ethical footprint
and they put on an opera all night long
you don't question that
it's so obvious
what is the abstraction
i know you understand that
that's what moves you
i'm in the crucible right now
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
i don't care
some people call it data science
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
i ran the camden police department because of that
it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
they're just waiting for their day in court
it impacts sentencing
it impacts crime and violence
now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
they're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
it impacts everything
and 67 percent of people come back
we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
we have no suspects
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
and i couldn't get this information out
and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
we have no suspects
so it's up to us
that option is actually not on the table
it's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of american
there's a flip side as well
why not just let businesses compete
they were right
it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
and you know what
we will not be there
so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
how far away was the finish line
i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
it's just incredible
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
how could i let them down
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
well we rejected all of that
well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
we'd love to help
well i didn't have any idea
i had to have faith
it would be a mall and not a park
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
why is it not working
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
i don't know
which incidentally is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
this is your chance
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
and they don't need to ask for permission
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
which brings me to my second point
i love red wine
it's a top predator
so let's start there
i want to know how i impact them
i made more money
supporting local economies
this is great
i'm going to be so healthy
i want to know how they impact me
lots of money
we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
so what to do next
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
you learn more about how computers work
he wanted to keep score
you can try it
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
i know nothing
and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
and i thought this would be great fun
so water was something that scared me to begin with
most of my friends were taking japanese
but i would go in on occasion
so i thought why not punish myself
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love languages
i was always very small
i tried everything
he could come over and help me
how do you change your behavior
that's more expensive
give me input
otherwise millions more will die
and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
and he's a bad guy
there were others like myself who were full time
it's not a dirty word
the children were killed on the spot
i don't have an answer
but that doesn't mean that we can't
you just had to do things sometimes
so we created a new school
how do you get to build those relationships
and boy they were like what
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
when you grow up poor you want to be rich
art is not efficient
human relationships are not efficient
efficiency is for robots
that's available right now
that was the only way to get anything done
i tried everything
maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
so why is it
why aren't people washing their hands
did you learn to wash your hands at home
did you learn to wash your hands in school
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
i don't know
but here's the thing
but in fact they found something very surprising
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
this is a real mystery
you would be issuing orders from above
but that really isn't true anymore
it's about the data
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
raise your hands
it's actually not that hard
that was powerful
he saw it written down somewhere
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
and looking at that pattern
thank you very much
and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
thank you very much
we wouldn't tolerate that
you smell money
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
but we're not there yet
there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
data drives better decisions
you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
it's a win all around
one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
now that's a very very good point
we were wrong
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
but i'm not happy
so i went to my doctor
we all want to
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
i do believe we can fix what's broken
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
we have to decide what it means
well not so fast
it showed no blockages
but for too many women that's not the case
and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
she found us we found her disease
but linda was lucky
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
we know that every cell has a sex
don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reason
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
have inspired a generation of innovators
but it wasn't just individuals
but those surveillance features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
i can hardly wait
and that's pretty amazing
has a coherent movement
look at this pretty structure
it's an automatic process
it's an unconscious process
i'm 27 years old
but it's different
are we brave enough to welcome it
this is not a put down of anyone
it is wrong
it is irresponsible
what a contradiction
i know it works
that would not work
now do something different
i am thinking of your love for me
i am torn by your love for me
i remember what you said to me
and i said i don't know
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
remember what i said my love
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
they just do it
not a lot of hands
again in a car
i was petrified
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
what are your intentions toward others
it's all about what can you do for me
whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
the answer to that question is a very definitive
agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
and that blew my mind
everything in the universe wears out
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
it's the war on terror
you don't do much editing
we've been working together since well since we were kids really
which brought us to this
so the answer to the second question can we change
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
we might say then well let's not worry about this
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
and how is that possible
we could only think of one way
well that's exciting
blocks have names
at the same time
we suspended our values
but it's not just china
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
where are the philosophers
there's no need to play the market
it's not a lot of money at the global level
i looked at slaves
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
how else can we create new ideas
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
i don't have an overview
because it's given by other people
trust is the response
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
let me give you a simple commercial example
that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
but people did not relate to this
i don't know
people started contributing ideas
and that's actually what happened
what is that
she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
that's something we ought to celebrate
something was wrong
has it gotten better
they supported me all the way through it
irreconcilable differences right
we're blessed with people who listen to us
because we can
can we really scale this up
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
how would i know what i was doing differently
i'm talking about teachers
one of them got caught up in the water
you don't get a chance to mess it up
make it about the other party
why did my child develop autism
it was appalling
how cool is that
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
thanks very much
what about polio
doesn't happen very much
no one's ever said that before
let's have that
it's a debate about words about metaphors
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
we don't trust the man
i do understand it
it has to stop
i don't know
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
what kind of trauma am i talking about here
for depression it was four and a half times
and i was really scared
but i found one
the irony is so obvious right
who or what inspires you and why
there's no structure
and i thought what am i thinking
he's five years old
it's not one way
we can't identify with that part
that didn't happen to me
make it go away
make it go away
make it go away
now i will maintain
what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
well what difference does this make
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
well why is that
and this is happening every day
and dance has progressed
my own website
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 emails
i was the first non family investor in amazon
i was a mediocre student
it has never happened
i am certainly not the hardest working
this is nonsense
i've built a career
it's a performance venue
we are magic
and they're not just focused on money
but it's not enough
i started off in uganda
we know that we are right and they are wrong
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
well that's what i thought
harness your internal strength
we harbor bias
i tried everything
i mean that interface is beautiful
you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
we're going to stay with them forever
designers aspire to be really great designers
i was talking about interaction design
what we want what we aspire to is the code
and does it matter
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
it's very hard to get of course
i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
why didn't you just tell me that
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
what would that change about how we live
i tagged along with my neighbors
who wrote that
i'll meet you there
and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
sort of leadership by humiliation
i said where is he now
thanks for asking
i'm in tucson
come on man
and let me just put this in context
we were obviously making a difference
we met men where they were at and we built a program
but we were still missing a critical element
and you know what else we did
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
take a look at one of our spots
and that's what we did
why do i believe this
we were making what was invisible visible
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
they're looking and looking and finding love
how could i come from a nation
the rituals were familiar
what kind of rituals are these
or where does he live
they have social meaning
strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
sometimes it goes further
they were unexpected pleasures
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
you board the plane
the plane takes off
the engine fails
what do we need to do
in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
that is not simply critical to our economy
what can we do in all of this
thank you very much
and remember we had experience with this
roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials
but eventually they did come around
and so it's perfect for something like that
you are a healer in a stone age village
we need to see beyond the surface
so this is obvious right
so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
but now it's turned around
then they had to bring them in
but you know what the actual facts are
there are no external cameras
my brothers are not as interested as i am
he was also the first person to call me a feminist
how are we going to do that
it's kind of the anti reality tv
nobody comes to get famous
and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
pretty much everybody else who does polls
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
and he grew up essentially in stage one
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
there was no road map
you know they do polls right
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
you don't want this
my life really sucks
and you don't leave them where they are
all of you are members of tribes
what about martin luther king
i don't know anybody
but i don't
life is great
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
but we're not done yet
the group gels
it is in the water
go i said again sweat forming on my brow
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
they want to be part of it
we can do it again
how frustrated are you right now
how sad are you right now
we take less notice of trivial matters
originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
but this particular reality was not inevitable
but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
that's the magic of the geological record
how do you find a dinosaur
i will not be played
rhythm is half silence
one woman gives birth to a baby
my spine curves spiral
harvest contaminated tobacco
cluster bombs left behind
one woman gives birth to borders
sickness health tender violence
i see now i never was one and not the other
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
faced with absence
one woman feeds on trash
one woman straps herself
we mourn women complicated
i will craft my own drum
one woman shoots her face
one woman loses her head
i live cycles of light and darkness
where do refugee hearts go
one woman never did
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a surgery lexicon
thank you very much
that's awful right
so they added oxygen to methane gas
the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
well you get several things
what's this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
and it doesn't
so naturally i asked what is african
they had hit the jackpot
i didn't want to
it wasn't like them to miss practice
life is good
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
the boys reminded me of home
1 percent who get to do that
i said in arabic
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
when it's 10 degrees below zero
could we merge
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
she suffered so much
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
we've all done this
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
that's pretty cool
we have the plan
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
there's pollination going on
and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
and this is crazy
there's people everywhere
every kid lives near nature
they grow crops
i just disagree with this
and i was like oh the amazon
i want to go
like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
of those seven have nuclear weapons
and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
it's a fucking orgy
why was it made
how is it made
they feel at home
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
which means take my camera
and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
women are worth it
so thank you for your attention
it told us about hormone replacement therapy
so we have these feast and famine cycles
well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
we've done the research
and not enough is being done about this
mortality is not going down it's going up
and in fact it probably won't
so what do you think happens to these gals
they're often not recognized sent home
she had to impersonate a man
i'm not sure what it was
and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
would you like to create a second one together
that's my question
we all know deep inside what the answer is
and they were basically having fun
we've known since we were babies
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
is it about systems
i started looking at them really carefully
we need to be part of a community to survive
is it about equality
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
you just have to find another term and look that up
i do like magic
there were no back doors
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
they have bad ideas
i'm the opposite
so that's it for now
beth israel's in boston
i think this is a problem
i actually have no idea why
go pick up the keys
i didn't talk to them
how do i get through the hardest part
and then what happens
often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
i think i'm a normal person
what are the researchers learning
so i was jealous
i know i didn't
we're always trying to make it faster
you need to be able to do something with it
we can get volunteers
we can drive around
we don't have enough money
okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
and we all know this
but i love it for a totally different reason
they make sense of the past
so no more missing guys
we're looking for something more
women's day was coming up
it's not exactly rocket science
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
i have passion in my heart
it's just a wall
let me tell you about a couple of them
we're not just part of the same species
we're part of the same family
i have three sons so i see how they fight
so that's what i'm doing
and i won't name names but you know who you are
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
the question why does she stay
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
i had just graduated from harvard college
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
and here's where those guns come in
but there's actually more to the story than that
what's different is how the molecules are put together
the oil will never run out
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
make me laugh
i forgive you and i do not hate you
he got part time i
that's a terrible waste of time
do that only if you're paid by the hour
the nazis invaded the netherlands
so thank you very much
surely we know enough
4 times the mass of the sun
and germany and france
my grandfather worked at this factory
my father worked at this factory he said
why not ask all of the states to do that instead
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
and that might have been the case
and that leads to a very powerful tool
i'm not a social problem guy
we just need to keep going
we have problems that we desperately need to solve
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
we don't need moore's law to continue
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what did happen to my brain
and so they took them to some safe place
now hamilton was everything madison was not
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
first they founded political parties
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pull and poke and prod things
we would just get noise back
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
why do we need to study this anymore
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
you saw him act
he made me feel smart
how are you
it's been thought about for a while
this is possible
the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
they were wonderful people
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
again it will not happen overnight
you might get impeached for that
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
even when it's so hard
i'm trying to become a better person
that's what happened with my dad
my dad has alzheimer's disease
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
and is this really the solution
i hadn't bathed in three days
and i cried
why are you really here
i was winning awards
i was no longer homeless
i was living in my own apartment
i didn't always succeed
well not yet
the silent majority does not need to be silent
we hear the chaos of war
young people as well
let's help them have a voice
we hear terrorism
and that's what we did
thank you very much
one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
just think about it
but it's a global phenomenon
what can i learn with you
does the water stay there forever
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they don't have meaning
so what happens next
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
what can i do about it
you've broken your back
you'll never walk again
how does it happen
this will pay dividends
but we all should
and in many cases we don't
how can we do it
you haven't earned it
we have to get quiet
i'll let you continue
thank you for your time
here i'm one person talking to you
you're all collective
and if it's completely okay what's the joke
so what is an idea drawing
we said yes
we were so excited
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
please sign here right now
no not how much
it goes wrong
it's more annoying
and that's powerful
or a firefly
why does a jellyfish emit light
but it's more complicated
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
i have an idea for saving the world
and he wanted one so badly
it's always what it was and what it can be
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
i wasn't very good at reading things
i wanted to stay in this relationship
why are we skipping over this
this is a really important chapter to me
things were going well
i went to the dean
it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
they will sit in them forever
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry
i didn't know where i was
it turns out the evidence says otherwise
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
it's a pretty simple idea right
it would stop
and i felt all this
it would start
so i learned never to move
it would skip a beat
i'm pushing and pulling with this object
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
my parents came from germany
constance baker motley
so what was i going to do
she never wanted to tell me
that is the right answer
well are you sure
you say you're working more than 60 hours
but you can write it
so how do we do that
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
we're seeing the baby brain
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
is it that i write very well
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
we have to fix the internet
we have to fix our education
he's at a technology conference in florida
most independent media was shut down
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
did you hear he has gone mad
i will not forget the day we got that text message
it's my dad
texting has a 100 percent open rate
that last one's an actual text message that we received
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
i think it might be a lifeline
he told me not to tell anyone
we're going down to the cellular level these days
think about that
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
terrorists are doing this
they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
there's a million different ways to eat pizza
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
and i said that's a good job
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
it's changed the way we talk
they don't trust the law
why don't they trust the law
the board of ed
it's not true
had no idea
but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
we can see how to do that
you're in there
and we couldn't just turn it off
that's really important
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is worth dying for
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so that was easy
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
don't create solutions to impress customers
three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
did you find the gold
i was going through a hard time as well
what about you
i was like what
it was like a star trek episode you know
i could make that decision
texting has developed one from this slash
casual speech is something quite different
that's what texting is
any spoken language that's used by real people has them
it's a marker of empathy
that's what we do
you were born to
and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
you know about numbers
that's not an improbable sample
you can navigate space
thank you very much
that is great
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
some did not everybody
even that wasn't enough
she wanted to change policy at the government level
so it's the demand that brings them to the table
even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
let's go back and visit our equation
how do you get informed
we're not going to be able to do that
we paid two to three times more than anybody else
there's no more of it
sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
we change the economics for the bad guys
so how does this work
they are doing it together
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
or any national leader
we can create a global parliament of mayors
he wouldn't like the answer
i have resources
